## UAV-based SfM
Why use SfM for mapping sinkhole characteristics?

## What is SfM?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
- 3D from overlapping 2D images
- Camera poses + sparse cloud → MVS dense cloud → DEM/orthomosaic

## Flight & Data

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
- ≥75–85% overlap; nadir + oblique
- GCPs or RTK/PPK
- Consistent exposure; avoid harsh shadows

## Products
- DEM/DSM, orthomosaic, point cloud, mesh
- Derivatives: slope/aspect, contours, DoD (change)

## Workflow Highlights
1. Plan & fly
2. Align images (tie points, bundle adjustment)
3. Densify (MVS)
4. Rasterize (DEM/DSM, ortho)
5. QC (RMSE vs checkpoints)

## For Sinkholes
- Delineate rims/depressions
- Metrics: depth, volume (cut/fill), slope, curvature
- Integrate with lineaments & karst layers

## Conclusion

- We want characterize the karst landscapes of Arizona
- We want to identify all the sinkholes and characterize theme
- SfM is a fast and accurate way to survey sinkholes 
- Much more work is done on the backend to measure and categorize sinkholes after point cloud aquisition
- There are many commercial and open source tools that can help with SfM
