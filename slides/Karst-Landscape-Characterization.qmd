# Why Karst Characterization?

- ~20% of global land surface shows karst features; many aquifers are karstic.
- Rapid, anisotropic flow → **flashy recharge**, **contaminant vulnerability**, **sinkhole hazards**.
- Management needs **spatially explicit** maps: recharge zones, flow paths, hazard areas.
- Goal: reproducible workflow to **identify lineaments** & **delineate sinkholes** and derive metrics (depth, volume, density).

::: notes
Motivation: water security, infrastructure risk, targeted recharge enhancement (ORE), and protection zones.

# What is “Karst Characterization”?

- Integrated mapping of **surface & subsurface indicators**:
  - **Sinkholes** (dolines), dry valleys, uvalas, caves/springs
  - **Lineaments** (fractures/joints/faults) guiding groundwater flow
- Products:
  - **Inventories** (points/polygons/lines), **density maps**, **terrain derivatives**
  - Suitability/recharge potential layers for decision support

---

# Datasets

- **Elevation**: 3DEP (10–30 m) or local LiDAR (≤1 m)
- **Imagery**: NAIP/Planet/Sentinel-2 (false color helpful)
- **Bedrock/Soils**: geology units, GLHYMPS, SSURGO
- **Hydrography**: NHD springs/streams; field GPS
- Optional: **UAV-SfM** for cm-scale morphology (lecture #2)

---

# DEM Preprocessing

- Reproject to target CRS (e.g., UTM 12N)
- Fill small artifacts conservatively (avoid erasing true depressions)
- Derive **slope**, **aspect**, **curvature**, **TPI/TRI**
- Multi-scale analysis (window sizes tuned to expected sinkhole diameter)

---

# Mapping Sinkholes (Raster-first)

1. **Closed-depression detection**
   - DEM fill vs. original → depth raster (Cut/Fill logic)
   - Threshold minimum depth & minimum area
2. **Morphology filters**
   - TPI/TRI, curvature (concavity), circularity metrics
3. **Vectorization**
   - Raster → polygons; clean with dissolve/simplify
4. **Attributes**
   - Depth, area, volume, elongation, circularity (4πA/P²)

::: notes
Use multiple scales (e.g., 5–50 m radii) to capture different doline sizes; validate with high-res data or field checks.

# Mapping Lineaments (Raster/Imagery)

**DEM-based (shaded relief):**
- Multi-azimuth hillshades; combine (min/mean)
- Edge detection (Canny), non-max suppression
- Hough Transform for straight segments; merge/extend with angular tolerance

**Optical imagery (optional):**
- Structural traces in bare or sparse vegetation
- PCA/band ratios; NIR enhances lithologic contrasts

**Postprocess:**
- Snap/merge segments, remove short/noisy lines
- Compute **orientation** (rose diagrams), **length density** (km/km²)

---

# Accuracy & Validation

- **Sinkholes**: compare to validated inventories or field points
  - Metrics: precision/recall/F1; positional & shape similarity
- **Lineaments**: compare to mapped faults/joints where available
  - Angular deviation; spatial coincidence; density correlation
- Sensitivity analysis over thresholds (depth, min area, Canny/Hough params)

---

# Typical Pitfalls

- Over-filling DEM removes real dolines
- Shadows/vegetation hide edges; water surfaces confuse matchers
- Anthropogenic depressions (quarries, tanks) → false positives
- Scale mismatch: pick window sizes that match geomorphic signal
- CRS/units mix-ups (meters vs degrees)

---

# Minimal Workflow (Concept)

1. Acquire & preprocess DEM (reproject, gentle fill)
2. Derive terrain attributes (slope, curvature, TPI/TRI)
3. **Sinkholes**: depression depth → threshold → polygons → metrics
4. **Lineaments**: multi-azimuth hillshade → edges → Hough → merge → stats
5. Densities/heatmaps; MCDA layers for recharge/hazard
6. Validate; tune thresholds; document parameters & uncertainty

---

# Outputs & Metrics

- **Sinkholes**: polygon inventory with depth, area, volume, circularity
- **Lineaments**: polyline set with azimuth, length; density rasters
- **Summaries**: per-HUC or management unit
- **Maps**: suitability/recharge potential, hazard zones

---

# Example Parameters (Starting Points)

- **Sinkholes**
  - Min depth: 0.5–2 m (res-dependent)
  - Min area: 100–1000 m² (context-dependent)
  - Circularity: ≥ 0.4–0.6
- **Lineaments**
  - Canny σ: 1.0; low/high: ~0.01/1.0 (rel. to shaded range)
  - Hough: min length 50–200 m, gap 20–50 m, angle tol. 5–10°

::: notes
Tune to your DEM resolution and expected feature size; keep a parameter log for reproducibility.

# Toward Decision Support

- Combine layers (weights/MCDA) for **Opportunistic Recharge Enhancement**
- Prioritize corridors where:
  - Sinkhole density is high and dolines are deep
  - Lineament density/orientation aligns with recharge pathways
  - Geology/soil support high permeability
- Flag conflicts: infrastructure, contamination sources, protected areas

# Next Lecture (UAV-SfM)

- cm-scale morphology of sinkholes
- Depth/volume via high-res DEMs
- Change detection (DoD) after storms/management actions
